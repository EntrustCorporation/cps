# 1. INTRODUCTION

Entrust Limited ("Entrust") uses its award winning suite of software products to provide standards-compliant digital certificates that enable more secure on-line communications.

The Entrust CAs issue Certificates, which include the following Certificate Types:

- OV TLS Certificate(s)
- EV TLS Certificate(s)
- Client Authentication Certificate(s)
- Code Signing Certificate(s)
- EV Code Signing Certificate(s)
- S/MIME Certificate(s)
- Document Signing Certificate(s)
- Time-Stamp Certificates(s)
- Verified Mark Certificate(s)

## 1.1 Overview

This CPS describes the practices and procedures of (i) the CAs, and (ii) RAs operating under the CAs. This CPS also describes the terms and conditions under which Entrust makes CA and RA services available in respect to Certificates. This CPS is applicable to all persons, entities, and organizations, including all Applicants, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Resellers, Co-marketers and any other persons, entities, or organizations that have a relationship with (i) Entrust in respect to Certificates and/or any services provided by Entrust in respect to Certificates, or (ii) any RAs operating under a CAs, or any Resellers or Co-marketers providing any services in respect to Certificates. This CPS is incorporated by reference into all Certificates issued by Entrust CAs. This CPS provides Applicants, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Resellers, Co-marketers and other persons, entities, and organizations with a statement of the practices and policies of the CAs and also of the RAs operating under the CAs. This CPS also provides a statement of the rights and obligations of Entrust, any third parties that are operating RAs under the CAs, Applicants, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Resellers, Co-marketers and any other persons, entities, or organizations that may use or rely on Certificates or have a relationship with a CA or a RA operating under a CA in respect to Certificates and/or any services in respect to Certificates.

In respect to OV TLS Certificates, Entrust conforms to the current version of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at <https://www.cabforum.org>. The Baseline Requirements describe certain minimum requirements that a CA must meet in order to issue OV TLS Certificates. In the event of any inconsistency between this CPS and the Baseline Requirements, the Baseline Requirements take precedence over this CPS with respect to OV TLS Certificates.

In respect to EV TLS Certificates, Entrust conforms to the current version of the Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates published at <https://www.cabforum.org>. The EV SSL Guidelines describe certain minimum requirements that a CA must meet in order to issue EV TLS Certificates. In the event of any inconsistency between this CPS and the EV SSL Guidelines, the EV SSL Guidelines take precedence over this CPS with respect to EV TLS Certificates.

In respect to Code Signing Certificates, Entrust conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Code Signing Certificates published at <https://www.cabforum.org>. The Baseline Requirements for Code Signing describe the minimum requirements for Code Signing Certificates. If there is any inconsistency between this document and the Baseline Requirements for Code Signing, the Baseline Requirements for Code Signing take precedence over this document with respect to Code Signing Certificates.

Effective 1 September 2023, in respect to S/MIME Certificates, Entrust conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates published at <https://www.cabforum.org>. The S/MIME Baseline Requirements describe the minimum requirements for S/MIME Certificates. If there is any inconsistency between this document and the S/MIME Baseline Requirements, the S/MIME Baseline Requirements take precedence over this document with respect to S/MIME Certificates.

In respect to Verified Mark Certificates, Entrust conforms to the current version of the Minimum Security Requirements for Issuance of Verified Mark Certificates published at <https://bimigroup.org/supporting-documents/>. The VMC Requirements describe certain minimum requirements that a CA must meet in order to issue Verified Mark Certificates. If there is any inconsistency between this document and the VMC Requirements, the VMC Requirements take precedence over this document with respect to Verified Mark Certificates.

## 1.3 PKI Participants

### 1.3.1 Certification Authorities

In the Entrust public-key infrastructure, CAs may accept Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) and Public Keys from Applicants whose identity has been verified as provided herein by an RA. If a Certificate Application is verified, the verifying RA will send a request to a CA for the issuance of a Certificate. The CA will create a Certificate containing the Public Key and identification information contained in the request sent by the RA to that CA. The Certificate created in response to the request will be digitally signed by the CA.

This CPS covers all Certificates issued and signed by the following CAs. The Root CA Certificates, Subordinate CA Certificates, and associated CRLs are disclosed through the CCADB.

### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities

Entrust does not use Delegated Third Parties to perform RA functions.

RAs under the CA may accept Certificate Applications from Applicants and perform verification of the information contained in such Certificate Applications, according to the procedures established by the Policy Authority. A RA operating under a CA may send a request to such CA to issue a Certificate to the Applicant. Only RAs authorized by Entrust are permitted to submit requests to a CA for the issuance of Certificates.

Third Party RAs may not be delegated to validate FQDNs, IP Addresses or email addresses per Â§3.2.2.4, Â§3.2.2.5, or Â§3.2.2.9.

The CA may designate Enterprise RAs to verify Certificate requests from the Enterprise RAâs own organization or from an organization of which the Enterprise RA is an agent. The Enterprise RA may as stated in this CPS:

1. authorize issuance of OV TLS and EV TLS Certificates with FQDNs which must be within the Subscriberâs Domain Namespace and that the Subject organization name is either that of the Enterprise RAâs own enterprise, or an Affiliate of such enterprise, or that the Enterprise RA is an agent of the named Subject ;
2. authorize issuance of S/MIME Certificates with email domains which the enterprise owns or controls and that the Subject organization name is either that of the Enterprise RAâs own enterprise, or an Affiliate of such enterprise, or that the Enterprise RA is an agent of the named Subject;
3. authorize issuance of other Certificates;
4. verify a meaningful representation of personal name, given name, and/or surname of the Subject of an S/MIME Certificate;
5. verify email address of an S/MIME Certificate; and
6. authorize revocation of the enterpriseâs Certificates.

### 1.3.3 Subscribers

Subscribers may use CA services to support transactions and communications. The Subject of a Certificate is the party named in the Certificate. A Subscriber, as used herein, may refer to both the Subject of the Certificate and the entity that contracted with the CA for the Certificateâs issuance. Prior to verification of identity and issuance of a Certificate, a Subscriber is an Applicant.

### 1.3.4 Relying Parties

A Relying Party is a person, entity, or organization that relies on or uses a Certificate and/or any other information provided in a Repository to verify the identity and Public Key of a Subscriber and/or use such Public Key to send or receive encrypted communications to or from a Subscriber.

### 1.3.5 Other Participants

## 1.4 Certificate Usage

### 1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses

This CPS is applicable to the following Certificate Types.

**OV and EV TLS Certificates**

OV and EV TLS Certificates are intended for use in establishing web-based data communication conduits via TLS/SSL protocols. OV and EV TLS Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. The primary purpose of an OV or EV TLS Certificate is to facilitate the exchange of encryption keys in order to enable the encrypted communication of information over the Internet between the user of an Internet browser and a secure server.

**Client Authentication Certificates**

Client Authentication Certificates are intended for use in establishing client authentication via TLS/SSL protocols. Client Authentication Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. The primary purpose of Client Authentication Certificates is to authenticate the identity of a client (such as a user or device) to a server.

**Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates**

Code Signing Certificates and EV Code Signing Certificates are used by content and software developers and publishers to digitally sign executables and other content. Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. The primary purpose of a Code Signing Certificate or EV Code Signing Certificate is to provide a method of ensuring that an executable object has come from an identifiable software publisher and has not been altered since signing.

**S/MIME Certificates**

S/MIME Certificates are used by individuals to digitally sign and encrypt electronic messages via an S/MIME compliant application. S/MIME Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. The primary purpose of a S/MIME Certificate is to provide authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures) and privacy (using encryption).

**Document Signing Certificates**

Document Signing Certificates are used by individuals to digitally sign electronic documents. Document Signing Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. Document Signing Certificates help to provide authentication and document integrity.

**Time-Stamp Certificates**

Time-Stamp Certificates are used by individuals to digitally sign Time-Stamp responses. Time-Stamp Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. Time-Stamp Certificates help to provide authentication and Time-Stamp token integrity.

**Verified Mark Certificates**

Verified Mark Certificates are used to assert a brand identification for message identification. Verified Mark Certificates conform to the requirements of the ITU-T X.509 v3 standard. Verified Mark Certificates help to provide email messaging integrity.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses

The use of all Certificates issued by the CA shall be for lawful purposes and consistent with applicable laws, including without limitation, applicable export or import laws.

Certificates and the services provided by Entrust in respect to Certificates are not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in or in conjunction with any application in which failure could lead to death, personal injury or severe physical or property damage, including the monitoring, operation or control of nuclear facilities, mass transit systems, aircraft navigation or communications systems, air traffic control, weapon systems, medical devices or direct life support machines, and all such uses are prohibited.

4. Trademark office name is required, if the applicable country/region has regional intellectual property agencies.

**Government Mark Certificates**

The CA or RA will perform the following:

1. Government Mark Verification
    1. Confirm that a Mark or equivalent was granted to or claimed by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity (International Organization) (or granted to a private organization or other organization by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity \[International Organization\] through official statute, regulation, treaty, or government action) as it appears or is described in the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action and confirmed by a Mark Verifying Authority;
    2. Maintain a copy of the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action including all official references (e.g., statute or regulation number and jurisdiction) and a copy of the Mark image as contained in or referenced by the statute or regulation.
    3. Retain a screenshot or other record of the Mark Representation provided by the Applicant and all information supporting the verification of the Government Mark obtained from the applicable statute, regulation, treaty, or government action.
2. Government Mark Ownership or License
    1. Confirm that the owner of the Government Mark confirmed is the same Subject organization verified by the Verified Mark vetting process under Â§3.2, or if the owner of the Government Mark is not the same Subject organization, that the Subject organization has obtained the right to use the Government Mark through statute, regulation, treaty, or government action, or by a mutually agreed-upon license from the entity who is the owner of record of the Government Mark. If the owner of a Government Mark is not the Applicant, the Applicant may only use the Government Mark if the CA obtains an authorization letter from the owner of record of the Government Mark.
    2. In determining whether the Applicant is the owner or a licensee of the Government Mark corresponding to the Mark Representation, the CA will maintain a record of its decisions and reasons therefor in the CAâs records required in Â§3.2.1
3. Confirmation of Mark Representation
    1. Confirm that the Mark Representation submitted by the Applicant matches the verified Government Mark and maintain a record of its decisions and reasons.
4. Color Restrictions
    1. Examine the Government Mark to determine what rights, if any, the Subject organization has to use of the Government Mark in the colors of the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber and maintain a records of its decisions and reasons.

**Common Mark Certificates**

The CA or RA will perform the following:

1. Proof of Prior Use
    1. Verify a Mark that matches the Mark Representation is currently displayed on a website. The Applicantâs control of the domain name of the website is verified using at least one method specified in Section 3.2.14, and a Mark that matches the Mark Representation was historically displayed at least 12 months earlier than the date of Mark verification on a domain currently controlled by the applicant, where the historical display is verified via one of the following archive webpage sources allowed by these Requirements.
        1. Archive.org
    2. Color Restrictions - Mark Representations in Mark Certificates follow the same color rules that apply to Common Law Marks in the applicable jurisdiction. In determining whether the colors in the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber match the colors permitted by the rules that apply to Common Law Marks in the applicable jurisdiction, the CA maintains a record of its decision and reasons.
2. Modification of Registered Trademark
    1. For verification of the modification of Registered Trademark, the CA performs the verification steps for the Registered Mark that is to be the basis of the modification proposed by the Applicant. The Applicant will provide the Mark Representation in SVG format that the Applicant wishes to include in the Mark Certificate.
    2. The CA accepts the following forms of modification of the Registered Mark in the Mark Representation:
        1. For Combined Marks, the location of any Word Mark elements may be rearranged in relation to the Design Mark elements (for example, the Word Mark elements may be relocated from the right side of the Design Mark elements to below the Design Mark elements, and may also include separating and stacking the Word Mark elements into a more compact area).
        2. For Design Marks and Combined Marks, a portion of the Design Mark element may be removed (but more than 49% of the Design Mark element cannot be removed), but the remaining Design Mark element cannot be altered from the original. In the case of Combined Marks, the Word Mark elements may also be relocated in relation to the remaining Design Mark element as described in (i).
        3. For Word Marks and Combined Marks where the Word Mark element consists of a single word, the one word may be separated into multiple parts which may be stacked or not.
        4. For Word Marks and Combined Marks where the Word Mark element consists of multiple words, may be separated into multiple parts which may be stacked or not, or the multiple words may be combined into a single word.
        5. Modified Word Marks may be shown in any font or color against a colored or patterned background.
    3. The CA will review the modified Mark Representation to determine if the modification makes a significant change to the obvious meaning of the original mark (as compared to the Registered Mark), and if so should notify the Applicant that the modifications cannot be accepted as submitted but must be further modified. The Applicant may continue to request a Mark Certificate with the requested further modifications at the Applicantâs option.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

The CA or the RA use the methods set out below to verify any individual identities that are submitted by an Applicant or Subscriber.

**OV TLS Certificates**

The CA does not issue OV TLS Certificates to individuals, where the name of the individual would be included in the subject field.

**EV TLS Certificates and EV Code Signing Certificates**

RAs operating under the CAs shall perform a verification of the identity and authority of the Contract Signer, the Certificate Approver, and the Certificate Requestor associated with Certificate Applications that are submitted by an Applicant or Subscriber. In order to establish the accuracy of an individual identity, the RA operating under a CA shall perform identity and authority verification consistent with the requirements set forth in the EV SSL Guidelines or the Code Signing Baseline Requirements published by the CA/Browser Forum.

**Class 2 S/MIME Certificates**

The Subject identity is authenticated by matching the identity provided by the Applicant or Subscriber to information contained in the business records or databases (e.g. employee or customer directories) of an Enterprise RA approving Certificates to its own affiliated individuals.

**Document Signing Certificates**

The Subject identity or the Applicant Representative identity is authenticated by face-to-face meeting or by means of a secure video communication where the Subjectâs valid government-issued photo ID is used to provide identity.

**Verified Mark Certificates**

The Contract Signer or the Certificate Approver is authenticated by face-to-face based on the requirements of the VMC Requirements.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

All Certificate request information provided by the Subscriber is verified in accordance using an independent source of information or an alternative communication channel before it is included in the Certificate.

### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing subject identity information is an organization, the CA or RA will use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authority and approval of the Applicant Representative to:

1. to act as an Enterprise RA;
2. to request issuance or revocation of Certificates; or
3. to assign responsibilities to others to act in these roles.

The CA or RA may use the sources listed in Â§3.2.2.1 to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the RA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the RA may establish the authenticity of the Certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicantâs organization, such as the Applicantâs main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the RA deems appropriate.

The CA allows a Subscriber to specify the individuals who may request Certificates and will not accept any Certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CAs will provide a Subscriber with a list of its authorized individuals upon the Subscriberâs verified written request.

**EV TLS and EV Code Signing Certificates**

The CA or RA verifies the identity and authority of the Contract Signer and Certificate Approver in accordance with EV SSL Guidelines section 11.8.

**Verified Mark Certificates**

The CA or RA verifies the identity and authority of the Contract Signer and Certificate Approver in accordance with VMC Requirements.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation or Certification

Externally issued Cross Certificates that identify Entrust as the subject are disclosed in Â§1.3.1, provided that Entrust arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship (i.e. the Cross Certificate at issue).

## 3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests

### 3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key

Each Certificate contains a Certificate expiration date. The reason for having an expiration date for a Certificate is to minimize the exposure of the Key Pair associated with the Certificate. For this reason, when processing a new Certificate Application, the CA recommends that a new Key Pair be generated and that the new Public Key of this Key Pair be submitted with the Applicantâs Certificate Application. If a Subscriber wishes to continue to use a Certificate beyond the expiry date for the current Certificate, the Subscriber must obtain a new Certificate and replace the Certificate that is about to expire. Subscribers submitting a new Certificate Application will be required to complete the initial application process, as described in Â§4.1. The RA may reuse documents and data provided in Â§3.2 to verify Certificate information per Â§4.2.1.2.

The RA that processed the Subscriberâs Certificate Application shall make a commercially reasonable effort to notify Subscribers of the pending expiration of their Certificate by sending an email to the technical contact listed in the corresponding Certificate Application. Upon expiration of a Certificate, the Subscriber shall immediately cease using such Certificate and shall remove such Certificate from any devices and/or software in which it has been installed.

OV TLS, EV TLS, and Client Authentication Certificates

The Subscriber may request a replacement Certificate using an existing Key Pair.

### 3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation

The CAs and RAs operating under the CAs do not renew Certificates that have been revoked. If a Subscriber wishes to use a Certificate after revocation, the Subscriber must apply for a new Certificate and replace the Certificate that has been revoked. In order to obtain another Certificate, the Subscriber shall be required to complete the initial application process, as described in Â§4.1. Upon revocation of a Certificate, the Subscriber shall immediately cease using such Certificate and shall remove such Certificate from any devices and/or software in which it has been installed.

## 3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request

A Subscriber may request revocation of their Certificate at any time provided that the CA can validate the Subscriber is the person, organization, or entity to whom the Certificate was issued. The CA will authenticate a request from a Subscriber for revocation of their Certificate by authenticating the Subscriber or confirming authorization of the Subscriber through a Reliable Method of Communication. Upon receipt and confirmation of such information, the CA will then process the revocation request as stipulated in Â§4.9.

An Enterprise RA may use multi-factor authentication to request revocation of a Certificate.

# 4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Certificate Application

To obtain a Certificate, an Applicant must:

1. generate a secure and cryptographically sound Key Pair, if not generated by a CA
2. agree to all of the terms and conditions of the CPS and the Subscriber Agreement, and
3. complete and submit a Certificate Application, providing all information requested by an RA without any errors, misrepresentation, or omissions.

Upon an Applicantâs completion of the Certificate Application and acceptance of the terms and conditions of this CPS and the Subscriber Agreement, an RA shall follow the procedures described in Â§3.2 to perform verification of the information contained in the Certificate Application. If the verification performed by an RA is successful, the RA may, in its sole discretion, request the issuance to the Applicant of a Certificate from a CA.

**EV TLS, EV Code Signing and Verified Mark Certificates**

1. Certificate Requester - The Certificate request must be signed and submitted by an authorized Certificate Requester.
2. Certificate Approver - The Certificate request must be reviewed and approved by an authorized Certificate Approver.
3. Contract Signer - A Subscriber Agreement applicable to the requested Certificate must be signed by an authorized Contract Signer.

One person may be authorized by the Applicant to fill one, two, or all three of these roles. An Applicant may also authorize more than one person to fill each of these roles.

### 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application

Either the Applicant or an individual authorized to request Certificates on behalf of the Applicant may submit Certificate requests. Applicants are responsible for any data that the Applicant or an agent of the Applicant supplies to the RA.

The CAs shall identify subsequent suspicious Certificate requests in accordance with the high risk process per Â§4.2.1.3.

The CAs do not issue Certificates to any persons or entities on a government denied list maintained by Canada or that is located in a country with which the laws of Canada prohibit doing business.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

The CAs require each Applicant to submit a Certificate request and application information prior to issuing a Certificate. The CAs or RAs authenticates all communication from an Applicant and protects communication from modification.

Applicants request a Certificate by completing the request forms online. Applicants are solely responsible for submitting a complete and accurate Certificate request for each Certificate.

The enrollment process includes:

1. Agreeing to the applicable Subscriber Agreement,
2. Paying any applicable fees,
3. Submitting a complete Certificate application,
4. Generating a Key Pair, and
5. Delivering the Public Key of the Key Pair to the CA.

The Subscriber Agreement may be signed in either of the following methods:

6. If the Subscriber Agreement is in electronic form, it will be signed with an online click-through process.
7. Subscribers may print and sign a signature page referring to the Subscriber Agreement, and email or upload the signed document to Entrust.
8. Subscribers may negotiate the agreement that gets signed either electronically or with manual "wet" signatures by both parties.

Signing Services are supported by Certificates issued in accordance with this CPS.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

The CA will follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate. In cases where the Certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA will obtain the remaining information from a reliable, independent, third-party data source.

**OV and EV TLS Certificates**

The Applicant information will include at least one FQDN or IP address. For EV TLS Certificates, the Applicant will include at least one FQDN.

#### 4.2.1.1 Applicant Communication

**All Certificates except EV TLS, EV Code Signing and Verified Mark Certificates**

The CA uses a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representativeâs certificate request. The CA uses the following sources to verify the Reliable Method of

Communication:

1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicantâs legal creation, existence, or recognition;
2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;
3. A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or
4. An Attestation Letter.

**EV TLS, EV Code Signing and Verified Mark Certificates**

The CA uses a Verified Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representativeâs certificate request. The CA uses the following sources to verify the Verified Method of

Communication:

5. Verify that the Verified Method of Communication belongs to the Applicant, or a Parent/Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Applicant, by matching it with one of the Applicantâs Parent/Subsidiary or Affiliateâs Places of Business in either the records provided by the applicable phone company, a QGIS, a QTIS, a QIIS, or a Verified Professional Letter; and
6. Confirm the Verified Method of Communication by using it to obtain an affirmative response sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude that the Applicant, or a Parent/Subsidiary or Affiliate of Applicant, can be contacted reliably by using the Verified Method of Communication.

#### 4.2.1.2 Validated Information Reuse

The CAs and RAs may use the documents and data provided in Â§3.2 to verify Certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves provided the data or documentation was obtained from a source specified under Â§3.2 or completed the validation itself no more than 825 days after such data or documentation was validated.

**OV TLS, EV TLS, Client Authentication and S/MIME Certificates**

For validation of Domain Names, email domains, and IP Addresses according to Â§3.2.2.4 and Â§3.2.2.5, any reused data, document, or completed validation can be obtained no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

**Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates**

Reuse of previous validation of Subscriber Private Key protection according to Â§6.2.11 methods iv, v and vii may be reused no more than 13 months after such data was validated.

**EV TLS and EV Code Signing Certificates**

Reuse of previous validation data or documentation obtained from a source specified under Â§3.2 may be used no more than 398 days after such data or documentation was validated.

**Verified Mark Certificates**

Face-to-face validation is not required more than once for any Subscriber as long as the CA maintains continuous contact with one or more Subscriber representatives and maintains a system for authorization by the Subscriber of new Subscriber representatives.

An authorization letter from the owner of record of the Registered Mark or Government Mark (as described in Â§3.2.2.10) may be reused for up to 1,858 days.

Other data of previous validation data or documentation obtained from a source specified under Â§3.2 may be reused no more than 398 days after such data or documentation was validated.

**Document Signing Certificates**

Reuse of previous validation data or documentation obtained for face-to-face meeting validation under Â§3.2.3 may be used no more than 60 months after such data or documentation was validated.

#### 4.2.1.3 High Risk Certificate Requests

**OV and EV TLS Certificates**

The CAs maintain procedures to identify high risk Certificate requests that require additional verification activity prior to Certificate issuance. High risk certificate procedures include processes to verify high risk Domain Names and/or evaluate deceptive Domain Names.

**Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates**

Prior to issuing a Code Signing or EV Code Signing Certificate, the CA will check an internal listing of organizations which have intentionally signed Suspect Code. The CA will not issue a Certificate if the organization has been listed.

The CA may issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity who is the victim of a documented Takeover Attack, resulting in a loss of control of the Private Key associated with their Code Signing or EV Code Signing Certificate. Except where issuance is expressly authorized by the ASV, the CA will not issue new Code Signing or EV Code Signing Certificates to an entity where the CA is aware that the entity has been the victim of two Takeover Attacks or where the CA is aware that entity breached a requirement to protect Private Keys under the requirements of Â§6.2.11.

#### 4.2.1.4 Subscriber Private Key Verification

**Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates**

Subscriberâs Private Key is generated, stored, and used in a suitable cryptographic module that meets or exceeds the requirements specified in Â§6.2.11. One of the following methods MUST be employed to satisfy this requirement:

1. The CA ships a suitable cryptographic module, with one or more preâgenerated Key Pairs that the CA has generated using the Hardware Crypto Module;
2. The Subscriber counterâsigns certificate requests that can be verified by using a manufacturerâs certificate, commonly known as key attestation, indicating that the Private Key was generated in a nonâexportable way using a suitable cryptographic module;
3. The Subscriber uses a CA prescribed crypto library and a suitable cryptographic module combination for the Key Pair generation and storage;
4. The Subscriber provides an internal or external IT audit indicating that it is only using a suitable cryptographic module to generate the Key Pairs;
5. The Subscriber provides a suitable report from the cloudâbased key protection solution subscription and resources configuration protecting the Private Key in a suitable cryptographic module;
6. The CA relies on a report provided by the Applicant that is signed by an auditor who is approved by the CA and who has IT and security training or is a CISA witnesses the Key Pair creation in a suitable cryptographic module solution including a cloudâbased key generation and protection solution; or
7. The Subscriber provides an agreement that they use a Signing Service meeting the requirements of the Code Signing Baseline Requirements section 6.2.7.3.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

The CA or RA rejects any Certificate application that cannot be verified. The CA may also reject a Certificate application if the CA believes that issuing the Certificate could damage or diminish the CAâs reputation or business including the Entrust business.

**OV TLS, EV TLS, Client Authentication Certificates**

The CAs do not issue OV TLS, EV TLS, or Client Authentication Certificates containing Internal Names or Reserved IP Addresses.

**EV TLS, EV Code Signing and Verified Mark Certificates**

Certificate issuance approval requires authentication by two separate Validation Specialists. The second Validation Specialist cannot be the same individual who collected the authentication documentation and originally approved the Certificate application. The second Validation Specialist reviews the collected information and documents for discrepancies or details that require further explanation. If the second Validation Specialist has any concerns about the application, the second Validation Specialist may require additional explanations and documents. If satisfactory explanations and/or additional documents are not received within a reasonable time, the CA or RA may reject the Certificate application and notify the Applicant accordingly.

If some or all of the documentation used to support the application is in a language other than English, a CA or RA employee or agent skilled in such language and having the appropriate training, experience, and judgment in confirming organizational identification and authorization performs the final cross-correlation and due diligence.

If the Certificate application is not rejected and is successfully validated in accordance with this CPS, the CA will approve the Certificate application and issue the Certificate. Additional Certificates containing the same validated Certificate information may be requested by the Subscriber via a confirmed communication and issued without further authentication during the period permitted before reauthentication of Certificate information is required. The CA is not liable for any rejected Certificate application and is not obligated to disclose the reasons for a rejection. Rejected Applicants may re-apply. Subscribers are required to check the data listed in the Certificate for accuracy prior to using the Certificate.

### 4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications

No stipulation.

### 4.2.4 Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Records

When CAA record checking is implemented, the CA checks for CAA records for each `dNSName` in the `subjectAltName` extension of the Certificate to be issued, according to the procedure in RFC 8659, following the processing instructions set down in RFC 8659 for any records found. If the Certificate is issued, it will be issued within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.

When processing CAA records, the CAs process the property tags as specified in RFC 8659. The CA does not act on the contents of the `iodef` property tag. The CAs respect the critical flag and will not issue a Certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property with this flag set.

The CAs may not check CAA records for the following exceptions:

1. For Certificates for which a Certificate Transparency preâcertificate was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which CAA was checked.
2. For Certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate as set out in Baseline Requirements section 7.1.5, where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual provision in the contract with the Applicant.

The CA treats a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:

3. the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and
4. the lookup has been retried at least once; and
5. the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.

The CA documents potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to the CAB Forum on the circumstances, and will dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA `iodef` record(s), if present. The CAs support `mailto:` and `https:` URL schemes in the `iodef` record.

Entrust CAA identifying domain is â**entrust.net**â.

**OV and EV TLS Certificates**

The CA performs CAA record checking on `issue`, `issuewild`, and `iodef` property tags prior to issuing OV and EV TLS Certificates.

**S/MIME Certificates**

Effective 15 March 2025, the CA will perform CAA record checking on `issuemail` property tags prior to issuing S/MIME Certificates. The CA will process the `issuemail` property tag as specified in RFC 9495.

**Verified Mark Certificate**

The CA performs CAA record checking on `issuevmc` property tag prior to issuing Verified Mark Certificates. The sub-syntax of the `issuevmc` property tag value is the processed the same as the `issue` property tag as defined in section 4.2 of RFC 8659.

## 4.3 Certificate issuance

After performing verification of the information provided by an Applicant with a Certificate Application, an RA operating under a CA may request that a CA issue a Certificate. Upon receipt of a request from an RA operating under a CA, the CA may generate and digitally sign a Certificate in accordance with the Certificate profile described in Â§7. An Enterprise RA can approve issuance of Certificates and submit the certificate request to an RA.

If a court or government body with jurisdiction over the activities covered by a CA/Browser Forum requirements document determines the performance of any mandatory requirement is illegal, then such requirement is considered reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal. The CA will notify the CA/Browser Forum of the facts, circumstances, and law(s) involved.

### 4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance

Certificate issuance by the Root CA requires an individual authorized by the CA (i.e. the CA system operator, system officer, or PKI administrator) to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform a certificate signing operation.

The CA will not issue Certificates with validity period that exceeds the validity period of the corresponding Root CA Certificate. The CA will not backdate the notBefore date of a Subscriber Certificate.

The CA enforces multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of causing certificate issuance or performing Registration Authority. In addition, the CA implements technical controls operated to restrict issuance of OV TLS, EV TLS and S/MIME Certificates through accounts which are limited to a set of pre-approved domains or email addresses.

**OV and EV TLS Certificates**

OV and EV TLS Certificate requests are reviewed using linting software to monitor adherences to this CPS, the Baseline Requirements and the EV SSL Guidelines limited to the linter coverage.

### 4.3.2 Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate

Once a Certificate has been generated and placed in a Repository, the RA that requested the issuance of the Certificate uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Applicant by email that the Applicantâs Certificate is available. The email may contain a URL for use by the Applicant to retrieve the Certificate.

## 4.4 Certificate acceptance

### 4.4.1 Conduct constituting certificate acceptance

No stipulation.

### 4.4.2 Publication of the certificate by the CA

No stipulation.

### 4.4.3 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

## 4.9 Certificate revocation and suspension

The CA revokes a Certificate after receiving a valid revocation request from an RA operating under such CA. An RA operating under a CA is entitled to request and may request that a CA revoke a Certificate after such RA receives a valid revocation request from the Subscriber for such Certificate. An RA operating under a CA is entitled to request and shall request that a CA revoke a Certificate if such RA becomes aware of the occurrence of any event that would require a Subscriber to cease to use such Certificate.

CAs do not support the suspension of Certificates.

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

#### 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate

The CA shall be entitled to revoke and may revoke, and an RA operating under a CA shall be entitled to request revocation of and shall request revocation of, a Subscriberâs Certificate if the CA or RA has knowledge of or a reasonable basis for believing that of any of the events listed in this section have occurred.

Where required by the third party requirements specified in Â§1.1, the CA will revoke a Certificate within 24 hours and use the corresponding reasonCode if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subscriber requests in writing, without specifying a CRLreason, that the CA revoke the Certificate (no reasonCode in CRL);
2. The Subscriber notifies the CA that the original Certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization (privilegeWithdrawn (9) reasonCode);
3. The CA obtains evidence that the Subscriberâs Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise (keyCompromise (1) reasonCode);
4. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>) (keyCompromise (1) reasonCode);or
5. The CA obtains evidence that the validation of the domain authorization or control for any FQDN, IP Address or email address in the Certificate should not be relied upon (superceded (4) reasonCode).
6. A Certificate is used to digitally sign Suspect Code (keyCompromise (1) reasonCode).

Where required by the third party requirements specified in Â§1.1, the CA will revoke a Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding reasonCode if one or more of the following occurs:

7. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of Â§6.1.5 and Â§6.1.6 (superseded (4) reasonCode);
8. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused (privilegeWithdrawn (9) reasonCode);
9. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement (privilegeWithdrawn (9) reasonCode);
10. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a FQDN, IP Address, or email address in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrantâs right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name) (cessationOfOperation (5) reasonCode);

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

CAs, RAs and Subscribers may initiate revocation.

A Subscriber or another appropriately authorized party (such as an administrative contact, a Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, Certificate Requester, or Enterprise RA) may request revocation of their Certificate at any time for any reason. If a Subscriber requests revocation of their Certificate, the Subscriber must be able to validate themselves as set forth in Â§3.4 to the RA that processed the Subscriberâs Certificate Application. The CAs shall not be required to revoke and the RAs operating under the CAs shall not be required to request revocation of a Certificate until a Subscriber can properly validate themselves as set forth in Â§4.9.3. A CA shall be entitled to revoke and shall revoke, and an RA operating under a CA shall be entitled to request revocation of and shall request revocation of, a Subscriberâs Certificate at any time for any of the reasons set forth in Â§4.9.1.

Subscribers, Relying Parties, ASVs, Anti-Malware Organizations and other third parties may submit CPRs informing the CA of a reasonable cause to revoke the Certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

A Subscriber shall request revocation of their Certificate if the Subscriber has a suspicion or knowledge of or a reasonable basis for believing that of any of the following events have occurred:

1. Compromise of the Subscriberâs Private Key;
2. Knowledge that the original Certificate request was not authorized and such authorization will not be retroactively granted;
3. Change in the information contained in the Subscriberâs Certificate;
4. Change in circumstances that cause the information contained in Subscriberâs Certificate to become inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading.

A Subscriber request for revocation of their Certificate may be verified by (i) Subscriber authentication credentials, or (ii) authorization of the Subscriber through a Reliable Method of Communication.

If a Subscriberâs Certificate is revoked for any reason, the Subscriber shall be notified by sending an email to the technical and security contacts listed in the Certificate Application. Revocation of a Certificate shall not affect any of the Subscriberâs contractual obligations under this CPS, the Subscriberâs Subscriber Agreement, or any Relying Party Agreements.

Subscribers, Relying Parties, ASVs, Anti-Malware Organizations and other third parties may submit a CPR by notification through the contact information specified in Â§1.5.2. If a CPR is received, the CA shall:

5. Log the CPR as high severity into a ticketing system for tracking purposes;
6. Review the CPR and engage the necessary parties to verify the CPR, draft a CPR investigation report and provide the CPR investigation report to the Subscriber and the party that provided the CPR within 24 hours from receipt of the CPR;
7. Determine if there was Certificate mis-issuance. In the case of Certificate miss-issuance, the incident must be 1) escalated to the policy authority team and to service management and 2) a Certificate mis-issuance report must be publicly posted within one business day;
8. If Certificate revocation is required, perform revocation in accordance with the requirements of Â§4.9.1.1;
9. Update the Certificate mis-issuance report within 5 days from receipt of CPR; and
10. Complete the CPR investigation report when the incident is closed and provide a copy to the Subscriber and the party that provided the CPR.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

In the case of Private Key Compromise, or suspected Private Key Compromise, a Subscriber shall request revocation of the corresponding Certificate immediately upon detection of the Compromise or suspected Compromise. Revocation requests for other required reasons shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Within 24 hours after receiving a CPR, the CA will investigate the facts and circumstances related to the CPR and provide a preliminary report to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the CPR.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA will work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the CPR or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the Certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which the CA will revoke the Certificate. The period from receipt of the CPR or revocation-related notice to published revocation will not exceed the timeframe set forth in Â§4.9.1.1. The date selected by the CA will consider the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of CPRs received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didnât receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

A Relying Party shall check whether the Certificate that the Relying Party wishes to rely on has been revoked. A Relying Party shall check the Certificate Revocation Lists maintained in the appropriate Repository or perform an on-line revocation status check using OCSP to determine whether the Certificate that the Relying Party wishes to rely on has been revoked. In no event shall the Entrust Group be liable for any damages whatsoever due to (i) the failure of a Relying Party to check for revocation or expiration of a Certificate, or (ii) any reliance by a Relying Party on a Certificate that has been revoked or that has expired.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

The CAs issue CRLs as follows:

1. CRLs for Certificates issued to Subordinate CAs are be issued at least once every twelve months or with 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate. The next CRL update will not be more than twelve months from the last update.
2. CRLs for Subscriber Certificates are issued at least once every 24 hours. The CRL validity interval is not more than ten days.


### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs (if applicable)

No stipulation.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

On-line revocation/status checking of Certificates is available on a continuous basis by CRL or On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

OCSP responses are signed by the CA or an OCSP responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked. The OCSP signing Certificate contains an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as defined by RFC 6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

The CAs support an OCSP capability using the GET method as described in RFC6960 for Certificates issued in accordance with this CPS.

The CAs sign and make available OCSP as follows:

1. OCSP responses for Certificates issued to Subordinate CAs are issued at least once every twelve months or within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.
2. OCSP responses for precertificates (RFC 6962) and Subscriber Certificates are issued at least once every 24 hours. OCSP responses will have a validity interval that is greater than 8 hours and not more than 10 days.

Note, the validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the `thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate` field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

Code Signing Certificates that have been revoked due to Key Compromise or issued to unauthorized person will be maintained in the Repository for at least ten years following revocation.

A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is either "assigned" with a Certificate or "reserved" with a precertificate. If not "assignedâ or "reserved", then the serial number is "unused". If the OCSP responder receives a request for status of a Certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder will not respond with a "good" status.

The on-line locations of the CRL and the OCSP response are included in the Certificate to support software applications that perform automatic Certificate status checking. A Relying Party can also be check Certificate revocation status directly with the Repository at <https://www.entrust.net/CPS>.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

No Stipulation.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise

If a Subscriber suspects or knows that the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key contained in the Subscriberâs Certificate has been Compromised, the Subscriber shall immediately notify the RA that processed the Subscriberâs Certificate Application, using the procedures set forth in Â§3.4, of such suspected or actual Compromise. The Subscriber shall immediately stop using such Certificate and shall remove such Certificate from any devices and/or software in which such Certificate has been installed. The Subscriber shall be responsible for investigating the circumstances of such Compromise or suspected Compromise and for notifying any Relying Parties that may have been affected by such Compromise or suspected Compromise.

Subscribers, Relying Parties, ASVs, Anti-Malware Organizations and other third parties may advise Entrust of a Private Key Compromise using one of the following demonstration methods:

1. Submission of a signed CSR with a common name of "Proof of Key Compromise for Entrust", or
2. Submission of a Private Key.

### 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension

The Repository will not include entries that indicate that a Certificate has been suspended.

### 4.9.14 Who can request suspension

Not applicable.

### 4.9.15 Procedure for suspension request

3. issuer: the byte-for-byte equivalent of the Distinguished Name of the CA issuing the CRL
4. this update: time of CRL issuance
5. next update: time of next expected CRL update
6. revoked Certificates: list of revoked Certificate information

**Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates**

CA may allow the CRL date and time of revocation to be backdated to convey the invalidity date in the event of Private Key Compromise or prior to date of signature on Suspect Code.

### 7.2.1 Version number(s)

CRLs issued by the CAs are X.509 version 2.

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

**reasonCode (OID 2.5.29.21)**

The CRLReason code extension may be used for revoked Certificates and will not be marked critical. The CRLReason indicated must not be unspecified (0) and if reasonCode unspecified (0) is used, the CA will omit the reasonCode entry in the CRL.

This extension must not be marked critical. The most appropriate reason must be selected by the Subscriber or the CA from one the following:

1. `keyCompromise` (1), if the key to the certificate has been or is suspected to be compromised or has signed Suspect Code;
2. `cACompromise` (2), if the CA has been or is suspected to be compromised;
3. `affiliationChanged` (3), if verified information in the Certificate has changed and as such the Relying Parties should no longer trust the Certificate;
4. `superseded` (4), if the Certificate has been reissued, rekeyed or renewed by another Certificate, the CA has evidence the validation of domain or IP address should not be relied upon or the Certificate was not issued in accordance with the requirements of Â§1.1 or this CPS;
5. `cessationOfOperation` (5), if the website or device is no longer in service or the Subscriber no longer controls the Domain Name or IP address; or
6. `privilegeWithdrawn` (9), if the CA determines the privilege of the Certificate issued the Subscriber no longer exists.

The default revocation reason is unspecified (0) which results in no reasonCode being provided in the CRL. The CA will not use reasonCode `certificateHold` (6). The `priviledgeWithdrawn` (9) reasonCode is not made available to the Subscriber.

If the CA obtains evidence of Key Compromise or the Private Key has signed Suspect Code for a Certificate whose CRL entry does not contain a reasonCode extension or has a reasonCode extension with a non-keyCompromise (1) reason, the CA may update the CRL reasonCode to `keyCompromise` (1).

If a Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA may use that revocation date in subsequent CRL entries for that Certificate. A more appropriate revocation date may be the date of Compromise or a date prior to the signature on Suspect Code.

#### 7.2.2.1 CRL Issuing Distribution Point

The CRLs do not support the Issuing Distribution Point extension.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

The profile for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) messages issued by a CA conform to the specifications contained in the IETF RFC 6960 Internet X.509 PKI Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Profile.

If an OCSP responder is used, then the issuing CA of the responder will be the same as the issuing CA for the Certificates it provides responses for. The OCSP responder Certificate will not be a CA Certificate.

If an OCSP response is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate, including Cross Certificates, and that certificate has been revoked, then the `revocationReason` field within the `RevokedInfo` of the CertStatus will be present.

The CRLReason indicated contains a value permitted for CRLs, as specified in Â§7.2.2.

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

No stipulation.

### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

The `singleExtensions` of an OCSP response does not contain the `reasonCode` (OID 2.5.29.21) CRL entry extension.

The OCSP responder Certificate:

1. Does not include `AuthorityInformationAccesssSyntax` extension;
2. Includes the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5);
3. Is not a CA Certificate, so the `basicConstraints` extension for the cA boolean is set to `FALSE`; and
4. The is no `certificatePolicy` extension.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties

As a condition of having any Certificate issued to or for Subscriber, each Subscriber (in this section, "Subscriber" includes "Applicant" when referring to any time prior to issuance of the Certificate) makes, on its own behalf and if applicable on behalf of its principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service relationship, the following representations, commitments, affirmations and warranties for the benefit of Certificate Beneficiaries, Entrust and any of Entrustâs Affiliates that will issue Certificates to or for Subscriber:

**9.6.3.1 For all Certificates:**

1. If Subscriber is applying for a Certificate to be issued to or for another Person, such Person has authorized Subscriber to act on its behalf, including to request Certificates on behalf of such Person, and to make the representations, commitments, affirmations and warranties in this Â§9.6.3 on behalf of such Person as well as on Subscriberâs own behalf.
2. All information provided, and all representations made, at all times, by Subscriber in relation to any Certificate Services, including in the Certificate request and otherwise in connection with Certificate issuance, are and will be complete, correct and accurate, including that any legal entity Subject legally exists as a valid entity in the jurisdiction of incorporation or registration specified in the Certificate (and such information and representations will be promptly updated from time to time as necessary to maintain such completeness, correctness and accuracy), and does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, unfairly compete with, or otherwise violate the intellectual property, or other rights of any person, entity, or organization in any jurisdiction. For clarity, in submitting any request for a Certificate using pre-qualified information, a Subscriber is deemed to be making anew the representations, commitments, affirmations and warranties set out in this Â§9.6.3, and Entrust will have no obligation to issue any Certificate containing pre-qualified information if such information is subsequently found to have changed or to be in any way inaccurate, incorrect, or misleading.
3. The Private Key corresponding to the Public Key submitted to Entrust with the Certificate request was created using sound cryptographic techniques and all reasonable measures have been taken to, at all times, assure control of (and, in the case of Code Signing Certificates and EV Code Signing Certificates, sole control of), keep confidential, properly protect, and prohibit unauthorized use of, the Private Key (and any associated access or activation data or device, e.g., password or token), including, in the case of Code Signing Certificates and EV Code Signing Certificates, in accordance with the "Private Key Storage" provisions of the Code Signing Baseline Requirements. For clarity, Key Pairs for Code Signing and EV Code Signing Certificates, Document Signing Certificates, and Time-Stamp Certificates are required to be generated in a cryptographic module that prevents exportation or duplication and that meets or exceed the requirements as defined in Â§6.2.11.
4. Any device storing Private Keys will be operated and maintained in a secure manner.
5. A Certificate will not be installed or used until Subscriber (or, in the case of Code Signing Certificates, Subscriberâs Agent) has reviewed and verified that the content of the Certificate is accurate and correct.
6. In the case of all Entrust OV TLS Certificates and EV TLS Certificates the Certificate will be installed only on servers that are accessible at the Domain Name (subjectAltName(s)) listed in the Certificate, and in the case of S/MIME Certificates, the Certificate will only be used on email addresses listed in the Certificate.
7. Certificates and the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key listed in such Certificate will only be used in compliance with all applicable laws and solely in accordance with the Subscriber Agreement.
8. The contents of Certificates will not be improperly modified.
9. Subscriber will notify Entrust, cease all use of the Certificate and the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate, and request the revocation of the Certificate,
    1. promptly, if any information included in the Certificate or the application for a Certificate changes, is or becomes incorrect or inaccurate, or if any change in any circumstances would make the information in the Certificate misleading.
    2. immediately, if there is any actual or suspected Key Compromise, or if control over the Private Key has been lost for other reasons.
    3. immediately, in the case of a Code Signing Certificate or EV Code Signing Certificate, if there is evidence that the Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code.
10. Subscriber will promptly cease all use of the Certificate and the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in such Certificate upon expiration or revocation of such Certificate.
11. Subscriber will immediately respond to Entrustâs instructions concerning any Key Compromise or misuse or suspected misuse of a Certificate.

    1. Subscriber breaches the Subscriber Agreement.
    2. Entrust discovers that there has been a Key Compromise of the Certificateâs Private Key.
    3. Revocation is required under the CPS, the Baseline Requirements, the EV SSL Guidelines, the Code Signing Baseline Requirements or the VMC Requirements.
    4. Entrust discovers that the Certificate is compromised or being used for Suspect Code or the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate has been used to digitally sign Suspect Code.
13. Where the Subject named in the Certificate(s) is a separate entity from the Subscriber, the Subject has authorized the inclusion of the Subjectâs information in the Certificate.
14. Subscriber owns, controls, or has the exclusive right to use the Domain Name or email address listed in Certificate.
15. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Entrust is entitled to modify the Agreement when necessary to comply with any changes in Industry Standards as defined in the Subscriber Agreement.
16. Subscriber will use appropriate judgment about whether it is appropriate, given the level of security and trust provided by Certificate, to use the Certificate in any given circumstance.

1. Subscriber will use commercially reasonable efforts to employ the code signing practices set out in the Code Signing Best Practices document made available <https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/whitepapers/code-signing-best-practices-v2.pdf> or by contacting Entrust ("Code Signing Best Practices").
2. Subscriber will generate and operate any device storing Private Keys in a secure manner, as described in the Code Signing Best Practices, and will use passwords that are randomly generated with at least 16 characters containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to transport Private Keys. Without limiting the foregoing, Subscriber will use one of the following options to generate and protect its Certificate private keys:
    1. Subscriber uses a tamperâresistant device, with a cryptography processor, used for the specific purpose of protecting the lifecycle of cryptographic keys (generating, managing, processing, and storing) ("Hardware Crypto Module") with a unit design form factor certified as conforming to at least FIPS 140â2 Level 2, FIPS 140-3 Level 2, or Common Criteria EAL 4+ ("Specified Requirements");
    2. Subscriber uses a cloudâbase key generation and protection solution with the following requirements: a. key creation, storage, and usage of private key must remain within the security boundaries of the cloud solutionâs Hardware Crypto Module that conforms to the Specified Requirements; b. subscription at the level that manages the private key must be configured to log all access, operations, and configuration changes on the resources securing the private key.
    3. Subscriber uses an organization that signs code on behalf of Subscriber using a private key associated with a code signing Certificate which meets the requirements of the Code Signing Baseline Requirements.
3. Subscriber will not request a Code Signing Certificate or EV Code Signing Certificate containing a Public Key that is, or will be used with any other type of Certificate.
4. The Certificate and the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in such Certificate will only be used for authorized and legal purposes, and will not be used to digitally sign Suspect Code.
5. An adequate network and other security controls will be provided to protect against misuse of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate.
6. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Entrust is authorized to share information about the Subscriber, signed application, Certificate, and surrounding circumstances with other certification authorities or industry groups, including the CA/Browser Forum, if:
    1. the Certificate or Subscriber is identified as a source of Suspect Code,
    2. the authority to request the Certificate cannot be verified, or
    3. the Certificate is revoked for reasons other than at Subscriberâs request (e.g. as a result of Private Key compromise, discovery of malware, etc.).
7. Subscriber acknowledges that ASVs may independently determine that a Certificate is malicious or compromised and that ASVs and ASV products may have the ability to modify its customer experiences or "blocklist" a Code Signing Certificate or EV Code Signing Certificate without notice to Subscriber or Entrust and without regard to the revocation status of the Code Signing Certificate or EV Code Signing Certificate.
8. Subscriber acknowledges that (a) the CA will not provide Certificates with signing keys that are less than 2048 bits, and (b) the CA will hash the Certificate with the SHA-2 algorithm.

**9.6.3.3 In addition, in the case of VMCs:**

1. Subscriber will apply for and use VMCs in accordance with and subject to the VMC Requirements.
2. The trademarks submitted in a VMC application represent registered trademarks that the Subscriber owns or for which it has obtained sufficient license to be able to grant the limited license in the VMC Terms, and that it will immediately revoke the VMC if it no longer owns or has a sufficient license to the applicable trademarks.

### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

4. The Relying Party shall trust and make use of a Certificate only if the Certificate has not expired or been revoked and if a proper chain of trust can be established to a trustworthy Root CA.
5. the Relying Party shall properly validate a Certificate before making a determination about whether to rely on such Certificate, including confirmation that the Certificate has not expired or been revoked and that a proper chain of trust can be established to a trustworthy Root CA.
6. the Relying Party shall not rely on a Certificate that cannot be validated back to a trustworthy Root CA.
7. The Relying Party shall make its own judgment and rely on a Certificate only if such reliance is reasonable in the circumstances, including determining whether such reliance is reasonable given the nature of the security and trust provided by a Certificate and the value of any transaction that may involve the use of a Certificate.
8. The Relying Party shall exercise its own judgment in determining whether it is reasonable under the circumstances to rely on a Certificate, including determining whether such reliance is reasonable given the nature of the security and trust provided by an Certificate and the value of any transaction that may involve the use of a Certificate.
9. The Relying Party shall not use a Certificate for any hazardous or unlawful (including tortious) activities.

# Appendix B - Subordinate CA Certificates

Entrust issues Subordinate CA Certificates to Entrust CAs and third party operated certification authorities.

**Subordinate CAs**

Entrust operated subordinate CAs are managed in accordance with this CPS or are operated in accordance with their own CP and/or CPS which meets the minimum requirements of this CPS.

**Third Party Subordinate CAs**

**Notification**

Before accepting an agreement to issue a Third Party Subordinate CA Certificate, the Entrust will notify the ASVs which distributes the associated Entrust Root CA Certificate.

**Registration**

Entrust specifies requirements to Third Party Subordinate CAs through written agreement. The Third Party Subordinate CAs must make use of a CP and/or CPS which meets the minimum requirements of this CPS.

The generation of the certificate authority Key Pair for the Third Party Subordinate CAs is to be witnessed by a third party security auditor.

A request for a Subordinate CA Certificate is started by the Third Party Subordinate CAs submitting a CSR. The CSR is authenticated by contacting the authorization contact for the Third Party Subordinate CAs.

**Certificate Renewal**

Subordinate CA Certificates issued to a third party may be renewed through mutual agreement. The Subordinate CA Certificate may be renewed using the original CSR which was submitted for the initial registration. If the renewal is performed with a new CSR, then the CSR is authenticated by contacting the authorization contact of the Third Party Subordinate CAs.

**Certificate Rekey**

Third Party Subordinate CA Certificates issued to a third party are rekeyed using a new CSR. The new CSR is authenticated by the authorization contact of the Third Party Subordinate CAs.

**Certificate Issuance**

The Subordinate CA Certificate issued to a third party is issued in accordance with the Subordinate CA Certificate profile defined in Appendix A.

**Certificate Distribution**

The Subordinate CA Certificate issued to a third party may be distributed in accordance with license set out in the written agreement between Entrust and the Subordinate Third Party CA.

**Certificate Revocation**

Entrust confirms Third Party Subordinate CA Certificate revocation requests by contacting the authorization contact of the Third Party Subordinate CAs.

In addition to Â§4.9.1.2, Entrust may also revoke any Subordinate CA Certificate in accordance with the agreement between Entrust and the Third Party Subordinate CA.

The revocation status will be provided by CRL and/or OCSP.

# Appendix C - VMC Terms of Use ("VMC Terms")

All Mark Asserting Entities (MAEs) are required, as a condition of being issued a Verified Mark Certificate, to agree to these VMC Terms. Any and all use, display, or reliance on any Verified Mark Certificate (and any Design Mark Representation and any other data or information therein) by Consuming Entities, Relying Parties, and any other person, is subject to and conditional upon acceptance of these VMC Terms.  The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.53087.1.1 in the Verified Mark Certificate incorporates by reference these VMC Terms.  If any person does not agree to these VMC Terms, such person may not obtain, use, publish, or rely upon any Verified Mark Certificate or on any Design Mark Representation or any other data or information in a Verified Mark Certificate.

1. **Definitions.** Capitalized words will have meanings set out in Section 1.6 of the Verified Mark Certificate Requirements.
   
2. **Limited Right to Reproduce and Display.** The MAE hereby grants, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions in the VMC Guidelines and these VMC Terms:
    1. to the Issuing CA, a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to issue a Verified Mark Certificate that contains the VMC Marks and to log said certificate in a limited number of Certificate Transparency Logs as required by the VMC Guidelines; and
    2. to Consuming Entities, a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to reproduce, display, and modify as permitted by section 3.1 the VMC Marks only in direct visual association with communications, correspondence, or services authored or provided by the MAE from or through one of the same domains included within the Verified Mark Certificateâs Subject Alternative Name field; and
    3. to certificate transparency log operators if different from the Issuing CA, a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to retain a copy of and to reproduce the Verified Mark Certificate to support a durable public record of those issued certificates, and for the purpose of permitting members of the public to audit the verification of Verified Mark Certificates.
 
3. **License Restrictions and Conditions.** Any Consuming Entity that incorporates or intends to incorporate the VMC Marks obtained through an issued and published Verified Mark Certificate into its products and services, agrees that its license to do so is subject to and conditional on the following:
    1. **Quality Control, Same Treatment.**  The Consuming Entity may not distort at display time any Design Mark Representation obtained from a published Verified Mark Certificate, change its colors or background, modify its transparency, or alter it in any way other than to adjust its size or scale, or to crop it in a manner consistent with cropping  performed on other Design Mark Representations displayed in the same context and where after such cropping the entire Design Mark remains visible. If a Consuming Entity displays a Word Mark obtained from a published Verified Mark Certificate, it must do so in a neutral manner applied consistently to all Word Marks from all Verified Mark Certificates that are shown in the same visual context. The Consuming Entity may display a Design Mark included in a Verified Mark Certificate without also displaying a Word Mark included in the same Verified Mark Certificate, but the Consuming Entity may not display a Word Mark included in a Verified Mark Certificate without also displaying the Design Mark included in the same Verified Mark Certificate.
    2. **No Partnership or Relationships implied.**  Subject to an express agreement to the contrary between the Consuming Entity and the MAE, neither the VMC Marks nor any other content of the Verified Mark Certificate may be used or displayed in any way that reasonably implies any relationship between the Consuming Entity and the MAE, beyond the bare licensor-licensee relationship created by these VMC Terms.
    3. **CRL or OCSP Checks.**  Consuming Entities must check the Certificate Revocation Lists maintained by the CA or perform an on-line revocation status check using OCSP to determine whether a Verified Mark Certificate has been revoked no less frequently than every 7 days.  
    4. **Lawful Use.**  Consuming Entities may only use the Design Mark Representation in a Verified Mark Certificate in accordance with applicable law.

4. **Sufficient Ownership or License.**  The MAE warrants that the VMC Marks published via a Verified Mark Certificate represent a Registered Design Mark (and Word Mark, if any) that the MAE owns or for which the MAE has obtained sufficient license to be able to grant the limited license in these VMC Terms, and that it will immediately revoke the Verified Mark Certificate if it no longer owns or has a sufficient license to the applicable Registered Design Mark (or Word Mark, if any).  The MAE will defend and will be liable for any intellectual property or other claims against any Consuming Entity, Relying Party or CA that arise from the content of the MAEâs application for a Verified Mark Certificate.

5. **No obligation to display.** The MAE acknowledges that Consuming Entities are under no obligation to display the VMC Marks in connection with content the MAE publishes that is associated with the domains the MAE owns or controls as a Domain Registrant, even if a communication or message is confirmed to be from the MAE and a suitable VMC Mark can be obtained and safely displayed from the applicable Verified Mark Certificate.  Instead, Consuming Entities may choose to display the VMC Marks in accordance with these VMC Terms, or not display them, at their option.

6. **Termination.** Immediately upon revocation or expiration of the Verified Mark Certificate, the MAE will cease publishing or using the Verified Mark Certificate, and the license granted to Consuming Entities in Section 2.2 above shall terminate.  The license to a Consuming Entity in Section 2.2 above also terminates automatically and immediately upon breach of any provision of these VMC Terms by the Consuming Entity.  Consuming Entities must immediately cease any and all use of the VMC Marks upon termination of the applicable license.

7. **Updates to VMC Guidelines and VMC Terms.**  The VMC Guidelines and VMC Terms may be updated from time to time.  All parties agree that the version of the VMC Guidelines and VMC Terms in effect at the time of issuance of a Verified Mark Certificate shall apply through the date of expiration or revocation of the Verified Mark Certificate (and, for those provisions that by their nature extend beyond the date of expiration or revocation, until the provisions no longer would apply by their terms). It is the responsibility of each entity who obtains, uses, publishes or relies upon a Verified Mark Certificate to review and familiarize itself from time to time with any updated versions of the VMC Guidelines and VMC Terms.
